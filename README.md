# kStats

A Matlab toolbox for statistical analysis used and developed by the Krekelberg Neuroscience Laboratory, Rutgers University - Newark.

* `+ma`- Tools for meta analysis, implementing the methods of Borenstein et al. Introduction to Meta‚ÄêAnalysis. Principles and Practice of Clinical Trials (Wiley, 2009). doi:10.1002/9780470743386.
* `+lm`- Tools for (generalized) linear mixed effects models, building on the Matlab built-in functions `fitlme` and `fitglme`.
